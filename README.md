# The Role of Sensory Uncertainty in Simple Perceptual Organization
This repository accompanies the manuscript by Zhou, Acerbi and Ma (2018). It includes human subjects' data and the MATLAB code used for fitting and comparing the models reported in the paper.

#### Data files
All subjects' raw data can be found in newsubjdata.mat, which contains two data structures: newsubjdataC for the collinearity task and newsubjdataD for the discrimination task. 

Each subject's data cell contains the following columns:
1. Eccentricity level (pixel)	
2. Offset (pixel)	
3. Trial type: 0 (non-collinear) or 1 (collinear)	
4. Response: 0 (non-collinear) or 1 (collinear)	
5. Confidence rating: 1 (lowest confidence) - 4 (highest confidence)	
6. Left line height (pixel)	
7. Right line height (pixel)	
8. Reaction time (s)
